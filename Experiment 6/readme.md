# FIRST and FOLLOW Sets Calculator

This C program computes the **FIRST** and **FOLLOW** sets for a given grammar. It prompts the user to input grammar productions in a specified format and then calculates and displays the FIRST set for each distinct nonterminal along with a union of the FOLLOW sets.

## Features

- **User Input:** Accepts up to 10 grammar productions.
- **FIRST Set Computation:** Recursively calculates the FIRST set for each nonterminal.
- **FOLLOW Set Computation:** Recursively calculates the FOLLOW set, including handling of epsilon (`#`) productions.
- **Recursion Guard:** Uses a recursion guard to prevent infinite recursion during FOLLOW set computation.
- **User-friendly Output:** Displays computed FIRST and FOLLOW sets in a clear and organized manner.

## Grammar Input Format

- Productions must be entered in the format:  
  `NonTerminal=ProductionBody`  
  For example, to represent the production _A â†’ aAaB_, enter:  
  ```
  A=aAaB
  ```
- If you need to use `=` as a terminal in the production body, use double equals (e.g., `S==A=a`).
- Epsilon (empty production) is represented by the character `#`.

## Compilation

To compile the program, use a C compiler such as `gcc`. For example, if your source file is named `main.c`, compile it with:

```bash
gcc -o first_follow main.c
```

This will create an executable named `first_follow`.

## Running the Program

After compiling, run the executable:

```bash
./first_follow
```

Follow the on-screen prompts:
- Enter the number of productions.
- Enter each production in the required format.

The program will then display the computed FIRST sets for each nonterminal and a union of the FOLLOW sets.

## Code Structure

- **Global Variables:**  
  - `grammarRules`: Array storing the grammar productions.
  - `firstSets`: Array to store computed FIRST sets for each nonterminal.
  - `tempFirst` and `tempFollow`: Temporary storage arrays for FIRST and FOLLOW computations.
  - `followRecursionGuard`: Array to prevent recursive loops during FOLLOW set computation.

- **Key Functions:**
  - `resetGlobals()`: Resets all global arrays and counters before processing the input.
  - `computeFirst(char symbol, int prodIndex, int bodyIndex)`: Recursively computes the FIRST set for a given symbol.
  - `computeFollow(char symbol)`: Recursively computes the FOLLOW set for a given symbol and adds the end marker `$` for the start symbol.
  - `computeFollowFirst(char symbol, int prodIndex, int bodyIndex)`: Helper function used in FOLLOW set computation for handling the symbol following a nonterminal.
  - `runUserInput()`: Handles user input, triggers the computation of FIRST and FOLLOW sets, and prints the results.

## Limitations

- The program is limited to a maximum of 10 grammar productions and assumes a maximum production length.
- Nonterminals must be represented by uppercase letters.
- The program may not handle all edge cases found in more complex grammars.
